##### Supervisions 

- **PhD Supervision:** 
    I am currently co-supervising the PhD thesis of [Gaspard Berthelier](https://3gaspo.github.io) , who is working on *Federated Learning for Time Series*.

- I co-supervised a group of three [ENSAE Paris](https://www.ensae.fr) MSc students for their for their [Applied Statistics Projets](https://www.ensae.fr/courses/1408-groupe-de-statistique-appliquee). Their work focused on *Few-Shot Learning for Time Series Classification in the Energy Domain*. The project details can be found on [this GitHub page](https://github.com/EtienneLnr/StatApp_ENSAE).

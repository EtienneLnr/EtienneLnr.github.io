I hold a PhD in Deep Learning from Sorbonne University, where my research focused on **Learning Neural Representations for Time Series**. You can find my manuscript [here](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04747432/file/143669_LE_NAOUR_2024_archivage.pdf). 

Currently, I work as a Research Scientist at EDF R&D, developing cutting-edge deep learning models for temporal data with applications in the energy sector. 

I’m always open to discussions about research and collaboration—feel free to get in touch!

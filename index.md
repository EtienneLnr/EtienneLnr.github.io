I’m an AI Research Scientist passionate about Deep Learning for time series and temporal data.  
My work focuses on designing neural architectures capable of learning from complex temporal dynamics — from forecasting to representation learning.  
Recently, my research has been centered on developing foundation models for time series, aiming to build general-purpose models that can transfer across domains and tasks in a zero-shot manner.

### Research Interests
- Deep learning for time series and spatio-temporal modeling  
- Foundation models, large-scale pretraining and inference adaptation for time series  
- Time series representation learning and self-supervised learning  
- Imputation, forecasting, and other supervised tasks  
- Scientific and industrial applications of AI

### PhD Thesis 

I hold a PhD in Deep Learning from Sorbonne University, where my research focused on **Learning Neural Representations for Time Series**. You can find my [manuscript](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04747432/file/143669_LE_NAOUR_2024_archivage.pdf) and the [slides](http://etiennelnr.github.io/assets/files/PhD_defense.pdf).
